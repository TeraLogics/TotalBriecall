## Agile Development Process & Tools

Our agile development process ensures that delivered results meet client objectives through continuous user engagement, analytics and feedback. Sprint cycles focus on the most important requirements first. Each sprint cycle incrementally plans, designs, builds, tests, and deploys prioritized capabilities. Requirements serve as the foundation of our efforts, but user engagement through demos, feedback sessions and metrics clarify how to implement the requirements and refine the success criteria for user stories. As requirements and solutions iteratively evolve through collaboration and incremental delivery, we remain flexible, scalable and adaptable to user needs. 

Primary goals/objectives for using the Agile development framework at TeraLogics:

- Deliver the highest business values early on in the project
- Promote customer satisfaction
- Provide customer-driven approach
- Focus on speed of delivery
- Provide openness and visibility to customer and internal stakeholders
- Remove impediments in a prioritized and systematic manner
- Improve employee satisfaction by empowering employees and promoting self-management, team communication, learning, and value-building

To achieve these goals and streamline delivery, we use the following variety of agile-management tools:

### [Trello] (https://trello.com)
 - Overview
   - Primary agile management tool used to track and manage sprint priorities  
   - Tracks sprint task assignments via boards, cards and checklists
   - A Task board is generated for each sprint iteration  

 - Benefits  
   - Allows users to directly input their requirements for analysis and fulfillment
   - Works with mobile devices so employees can view tasks from their device of choice
   - Enhances real-time team visibility into sprint tasking and status (for both the development team and management)
   - Promotes accountability for task assignments

### [Github] (https://github.com/)
 - Overview
   - Web-based code repository manager
   - Contains [wiki] (https://github.com/TeraLogics/TotalBriecall/wiki) and [issue] (https://github.com/TeraLogics/TotalBriecall/issues) tracking features
   - Assists with code reviews
   - Primary mechanism for tracking and managing [bugs & issues] (https://github.com/TeraLogics/TotalBriecall/issues) reported to delivery team 
   - Uses branches to store code, along with the wiki for internal docs, such as:
     - Design / mockups
     - Development notes
     - Installation instructions
     - Test cases

 - Benefits
   - Improves developer collaboration through git branches and merging
   - Ensures that code archives are maintained through commit logs and branches
   - Provides real-time activity stream of code changes and check-ins to keep team members up to date on changes
   - Makes code issues and improvements visible across the team
   - Enhances code reviews process to ensure coding standards are met

### [Slack] (https://slack.com)
 - Overview
   - Primary team chat application that works on three levels:  
     - Channel based communications
     - One-on-one communications
     - Private groups
   - Changes communication from point-to-point to collaborative discussions
   - Creates a direct and open environment for the team to stay in tune on projects and tasking
   - Multiple web integrations with other popular development tools
   - The ability to create custom webhooks for specific cases

 - Benefits
   - Centralizes team communication, making it easier for staff to search, find, and react to events
   - Creates open or private channels for projects, groups and topics for the team to share, reducing lost or split communication 
   - Reduces dependency on emails
   - Connects via API to key services/tools in our development process (e.g. Google Apps, Trello, GitHub, TravisCI), creating a central location for viewing project status and updates

### [InVision] (http://www.invisionapp.com)
 - Overview 
   - Rapid prototyping tool for User Interfaces
   - Create interactive UI mockups for multiple screen sizes simultaneously
   - Collect user feedback directly on mockups with threaded discussions
 
 - Benefits 
   - Save time by testing designs without writing code
   - Users are immersed in the design by using their own devices
   - Gathers pinpoint feedback about UI features
